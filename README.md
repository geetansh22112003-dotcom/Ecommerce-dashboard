🛒 E-Commerce Sales Dashboard | Power BI

✨ Project Overview

This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze e-commerce sales performance and uncover actionable business insights.
It demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into decisions using Power BI, SQL, DAX, and data modeling techniques.

The dashboard answers critical business questions like:
   •	📈 Which product categories are driving the most revenue?
   •	🌍 Which regions are underperforming in sales?
   •	💳 What are customers’ preferred payment methods?
   •	⏳ How do profits fluctuate month-to-month and across quarters?


🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this dashboard is to provide decision-makers in an e-commerce business with a single, interactive view of sales performance. Instead of relying on scattered spreadsheets and manual reports, this dashboard delivers:
  •	Centralized KPIs → Sales, Profit, Quantity, and AOV at a glance
  •	Deeper insights into regions, product categories, sub-categories, and customer contributions
  •	Actionable analysis of payment modes and seasonal profit trends
  •	Faster reporting that reduces manual effort and enables real-time decision-making
In short, the dashboard turns raw transactional data into business intelligence that supports sales strategy, marketing campaigns, inventory planning, and customer retention initiatives.
